# Madd-E: An Object Identification and Madlib Generator

## Overview
As my first time participating in a hackathon, I created a program that can identify objects using DepthAI in python, output the result into TXT and run a C++ script to create a randomly generated madlib about it. From there it is brought back to python where the output.txt is read using TTS. This project won 2nd place overall at the Gonzaga University ACM Hackathon 2022.

Features:

* Visual Object Recognition
* Random generation from a database of madlibs
* Text to speech story telling

### Built With

This section below contains the major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap our project.

* DepthAI
* Python
* C++
* gTTS

## Usage

This project is not recommended to be run, and requires an object recognition camera from DepthAI and the helper test program.
