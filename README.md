Created as a project for the Gonzaga University Hackathon 2022, this program can identify objects using DepthAI, output the result into TXT and run a C++ script to create a randomly generated madlib about it. From there it is brought back to python where the output.txt is read using TTS. This project won 2nd place in the event and was creaated with the help of: Aiden Tabrah, Charles Bennington, and Alex Nicolazzo.
