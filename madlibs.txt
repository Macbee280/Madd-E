Dear _NAME_,
I am having a _ADJECTIVE_ time at _NOUN_. The _OCCUPATION_ is
_ADJECTIVE_ and the food is _ADJECTIVE_. I met _NAME_ and we
became _ADJECTIVE_ friends. Unfortunately, _NAME_ is _ADJECTIVE_
and I _ED_ my _BODY PART_ so we couldn't go to _PLACE_.
I was excited to _VERB_ the _NOUN_s, so please _ADJECTIVE_ _VERB_ more
when you _VERB_ back.
Your _ADJECTIVE_ness,
_NAME_

there once was a _NOUN_ it was a very _ADJECTIVE_ _NOUN_,
it loved to _VERB_. It had a family.
It's mother was _NAME_ and it's father was _NAME_

_ADJECTIVE_ Macdonald had a _NOUN_, E-I-E-I-O
and on that _NOUN_ he had an _ANIMAL_, E-I-E-I-O
with a _NOISE_ _NOISE_ here
and a _NOISE_ _NOISE_ there,
here a _NOISE_, there a _NOISE_,
everywhere a _NOISE_ _NOISE_,
_ADJECTIVE_ Macdonald had a _NOUN_, E-I-E-I-O.
|
I enjoy long, _ADJECTIVE_ walks on the _PLACE_, getting _ED_ 
in the rain and serendipitous encounters with _NOUN_s.
I really like pina coladas mixed with _LIQUID_, and romantic, candle-lit _NOUN_s. 
I travel frequently, especially to _PLACE_, when I am not busy with work. 
(I am a _OCCUPATION_.) I am looking for _NOUN_ and _NOUN_ in the form of a _ADJECTIVE_ goddess.
I would prefer if she knew how to _VERB_, _VERB_, and _VERB_ my _NOUN_.
|
Drinking _LIQUID_, is my favorite activity, My name is _NOUN_n' _NAME_.
I work at _PLACE_ as an _OCCUPATION_, I have worked at here for _NUMBER_ years.
I am a _ADJECTIVE_ expert in _LIQUID_.
|
There once was a young _NOUN_,
They loved to _VERB_ in _PLACE_, it was their _ADJECTIVE_ activity.
They had a freind, _NOUN_, who loved to _VERB_. Despite the two's diffrences they were great friends, and _ED_ everywhere.
|
_NAME_ loves _NAME_'s _NOUN_. It is really _ADJECTIVE_, and I _VERB_ with it often.
_NOUN_'s are one of the best things in _PLACE_. Every day I wake up and I think about _LIQUID_ 
because of _NOUN_.
|
_PLACE_ is my most _ADJECTIVE_ place of all time.
I have been going there for _NUMBER_ years (I am _NUMBER_ years old).
I think the most _ADJECTIVE_ things about it are the _NOUN_s, _NOUN_s, and the _NOUN_s.
I would _VERB_ with the _NOUN_ when I got bored of this place and _VERB_ at _PLACE_. I hated the _OCCUPATION_ that worked there.
